    "### Portfolio Optimization Problem Formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "The classical **mean-variance portfolio optimization** problem, introduced by Markowitz (1952), aims to minimize portfolio risk for a given level of expected return (or equivalently, balance both using a risk aversion parameter). It is formulated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\min_{w \\in \\mathbb{R}^N} \\quad w^\\top \\Sigma w - \\gamma \\mu^\\top w \\quad \\text{subject to} \\quad \\mathbf{1}^\\top w = 1,\\quad 0 \\leq w_i \\leq 1 \\quad \\forall i \\in \\{1, \\ldots, N\\}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $ w = (w_1, \\ldots, w_N)^\\top $ is the vector of portfolio weights  \n",
    "- $ \\Sigma \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times N} $ is the **covariance matrix** of asset returns  \n",
    "- $ \\mu \\in \\mathbb{R}^N $ is the **expected return vector**  \n",
    "- $ \\gamma > 0 $ is the **risk aversion coefficient**  \n",
    "- $ \\mathbf{1} \\in \\mathbb{R}^N $ is a vector of ones  \n",
    "- The constraint $ \\mathbf{1}^\\top w = 1 $ ensures the portfolio is fully invested  \n",
    "- The box constraint $ 0 \\leq w_i \\leq 1 $ limits individual asset weights\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a **convex quadratic program** and can be efficiently solved using standard optimization methods.\n",

    "This classical model is easy to solve due to its convexity, but it does not capture important practical constraints that investors often face. In real-world applications, it is common to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reduce transaction costs  \n",
    "- Control portfolio complexity  \n",
    "- Avoid excessive concentration in a few assets\n",
    "\n",
    "To reflect these needs, we introduce two key extensions:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Cardinality Constraint\n",
    "\n",
    "Investors may want to limit the total number of assets in the portfolio. Let $\\Delta \\in \\mathbb{N}_+$ denote the maximum allowed number of assets. This leads to the **cardinality constraint**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\|w\\|_0 \\leq \\Delta\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $\\|w\\|_0$ is the **zero-norm**, which counts the number of nonzero entries in $w$. This constraint is **non-convex** and introduces **combinatorial complexity**, requiring the use of binary decision variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Box Constraint on Asset Weights\n",
    "\n",
    "To prevent overexposure to individual assets, we constrain each weight to lie within a maximum threshold. Let $\\bar{w} \\in (0, 1]$ be the maximum allowable weight per asset. The constraint is written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "w \\in [0, \\bar{w}]^N\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This **box constraint** ensures no single asset can dominate the portfolio, and also helps with regulatory compliance or risk diversification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these constraints transform the problem into a **Mixed-Integer Quadratic Program (MIQP)**, which is computationally much harder to solve than the unconstrained case.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then formulate the **Cardinality-Constrained Mean-Variance (CCMV)** optimization problem as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "w^*(\\Delta, \\bar{w}) = \\arg\\min_{w \\in \\mathbb{R}^N} \\quad w^\\top \\Sigma w - \\gamma \\mu^\\top w \\quad \\text{subject to} \\quad \\mathbf{1}^\\top w = 1, \\quad 0 \\leq w_i \\leq \\bar{w} \\quad \\forall i, \\quad \\|w\\|_0 \\leq \\Delta\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, it can be shown that this problem is NP-hard due to the combinatorial nature of the cardinality constraint. The introduction of binary variables to enforce this constraint complicates the optimization significantly.\n"

    "### Solving the CCMV Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Cardinality-Constrained Mean-Variance (CCMV)** problem is computationally challenging due to its non-convex nature and the presence of binary decisions. To address this, we adopt the **clustering-based approach** proposed in the paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we apply **hierarchical clustering** to group assets based on the similarity of their return profiles. Each cluster represents a group of highly correlated assets, and we solve the CCMV problem using the **cluster centroids** as representative assets.\n",
    "\n",
    "This technique offers two key advantages:\n",
    "- It **reduces the dimensionality** of the problem, making it more tractable.\n",
    "- It **preserves key structure** in the data by exploiting the correlation between assets within each cluster.\n",

    "\n",
    "We now implement the hierarchical clustering approach, following the pseudo-code provided in the paper. This algorithm clusters assets based on the similarity of their return profiles by analyzing the correlation structure of the return matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this step is to reduce the dimensionality of the portfolio optimization problem by grouping similar assets together. This allows us to simplify the later stages of solving the CCMV problem, while still preserving the core structure of the asset universe.\n",
    "\n",
    "The clustering is performed using a bottom-up (agglomerative) approach, with distances computed between cluster centroids in the distance space. The final partition is determined by cutting the dendrogram at the optimal level, based on the largest gap in merge distances."
