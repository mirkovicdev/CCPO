    "This classical model is easy to solve due to its convexity, but it does not capture important practical constraints that investors often face. In real-world applications, it is common to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reduce transaction costs  \n",
    "- Control portfolio complexity  \n",
    "- Avoid excessive concentration in a few assets\n",
    "\n",
    "To reflect these needs, we introduce two key extensions:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Cardinality Constraint\n",
    "\n",
    "Investors may want to limit the total number of assets in the portfolio. Let $\\Delta \\in \\mathbb{N}_+$ denote the maximum allowed number of assets. This leads to the **cardinality constraint**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\|w\\|_0 \\leq \\Delta\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $\\|w\\|_0$ is the **zero-norm**, which counts the number of nonzero entries in $w$. This constraint is **non-convex** and introduces **combinatorial complexity**, requiring the use of binary decision variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Box Constraint on Asset Weights\n",
    "\n",
    "To prevent overexposure to individual assets, we constrain each weight to lie within a maximum threshold. Let $\\bar{w} \\in (0, 1]$ be the maximum allowable weight per asset. The constraint is written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "w \\in [0, \\bar{w}]^N\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This **box constraint** ensures no single asset can dominate the portfolio, and also helps with regulatory compliance or risk diversification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these constraints transform the problem into a **Mixed-Integer Quadratic Program (MIQP)**, which is computationally much harder to solve than the unconstrained case.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then formulate the **Cardinality-Constrained Mean-Variance (CCMV)** optimization problem as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "w^*(\\Delta, \\bar{w}) = \\arg\\min_{w \\in \\mathbb{R}^N} \\quad w^\\top \\Sigma w - \\gamma \\mu^\\top w \\quad \\text{subject to} \\quad \\mathbf{1}^\\top w = 1, \\quad 0 \\leq w_i \\leq \\bar{w} \\quad \\forall i, \\quad \\|w\\|_0 \\leq \\Delta\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, it can be shown that this problem is NP-hard due to the combinatorial nature of the cardinality constraint. The introduction of binary variables to enforce this constraint complicates the optimization significantly.\n"
